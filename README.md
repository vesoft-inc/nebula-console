Check options for `./nebula-console -h`, try `./nebula-console` in interactive mode directly.
And try `./nebula-console -e 'show hosts'` for the direct script mode.
And try `./nebula-console -f demo.nGQL` for the script file mode.

## Export mode for Nebula Graph Console

When the export mode is enabled, Nebula Graph Console exports all the query results into a CSV file. When the export mode is disabled, the export stops. The syntax is as follows.

> **NOTE**: The following commands are case insensitive.

* Enable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :set CSV <your_file.csv>
```

* Disable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :unset CSV
```

## Load nba dataset

To load the demonstration nba dataset, make sure that Console is connected to Nebula Graph.

```ngql
nebula> :play nba
Start loading dataset nba...

Load dataset succeeded!
```

## Export .dot file

To export the graviz text to a `.dot` format, run the following command:

```ngql
nebula> :set dot <filename>
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> TODO
```

## Disconnect Nebula Graph Console from Nebula Graph

You can use `:EXIT` or `:QUIT` to disconnect from Nebula Graph. For convenience, nebula-console supports using these commands in lower case without the colon (":"), such as `quit`.

```nGQL
nebula> :QUIT

Bye root!

nebula> :EXIT

Bye root!

nebula> quit

Bye root!

nebula> exit

Bye root!
```
