## How to Install

### From Source Code

1. Build Nebula Graph Console

    To build Nebula Graph Console, make sure that you have installed [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

    > NOTE: Go version provided with apt on ubuntu is usually "outdated".  

    Run the following command to examine if Go is installed on your machine.

    ```bash
    $ go version
    ```

    The version should be newer than 1.13.

    Use Git to clone the source code of Nebula Graph Console to your host.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/vesoft-inc/nebula-console
    ```

    Run the following command to build Nebula Graph Console.

    ```bash
    $ cd nebula-console
    $ make
    ```
    You can find a binary named `nebula-console`.

2. Connect to Nebula Graph

    To connect to your Nebula Graph services, use the following command.

    ```bash
    $ ./nebula-console -addr <ip> -port <port> -u <username> -p <password>
        [-t 120] [-e "nGQL_statement" | -f filename.nGQL]
    ```

    | Option          | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | ------------    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `-h`            | Shows the help menu.                                                                                                                                                          |
    | `-addr/-address`| Sets the IP/HOST address of the graphd service.   
                                                                                 |
    | `-P/-port`      | Sets the port number of the graphd service.                                                                                                                                   |
    | `-u/-user`      | Sets the username of your Nebula Graph account. See [authentication](https://docs.nebula-graph.io/2.0/7.data-security/1.authentication/1.authentication/).                    |
    | `-p/-password`  | Sets the password of your Nebula Graph account.                                                                                                                               |
    | `-t/-timeout`   | Sets an integer-type timeout threshold for the connection. The unit is second. The default value is 120.                                                                      |
    | `-e/-eval`      | Sets a string-type nGQL statement. The nGQL statement is executed once the connection succeeds. The connection stops after the result is returned.                            |
    | `-f/-file`      | Sets the path of an nGQL file. The nGQL statements in the file are executed once the connection succeeds. You'll get the return messages and the connection stops then.       |


    E.g.,
    ```bash
    $./nebula-console -addr=192.168.10.111 -port 9669 -u root -p nebula
    2021/03/15 15:21:43 [INFO] connection pool is initialized successfully
    Welcome to Nebula Graph!
    ```

    Check options for `./nebula-console -h`:

    - try `./nebula-console` in interactive mode directly.

    - And try `./nebula-console -e 'show hosts'` for the direct script mode.

    - And try `./nebula-console -f demo.nGQL` for the script file mode.

### Docker

Create a container:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -ti --network nebula-docker-compose_nebula-net --entrypoint=/bin/sh vesoft/nebula-console:v2-nightly
```

To connect to your Nebula Graph services, run the follow command in the container:

```bash
docker> nebula-console -u <user> -p <password> --address=<graphd> --port=9669
```


## Export mode for Nebula Graph Console

When the export mode is enabled, Nebula Graph Console exports all the query results into a CSV file. When the export mode is disabled, the export stops. The syntax is as follows.

> **NOTE**: The following commands are case insensitive.

* Enable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :set CSV <your_file.csv>
```

* Disable nebula-console export mode:

```nGQL
nebula> :unset CSV
```

## Load nba dataset

To load the demonstration nba dataset, make sure that Console is connected to Nebula Graph.

```ngql
nebula> :play nba
Start loading dataset nba...

Load dataset succeeded!
```

## Export .dot file

To export the graviz text to a `.dot` format, run the following command:

```ngql
nebula> :set dot <filename>
```

For example:

```ngql
nebula> TODO
```

## Disconnect Nebula Graph Console from Nebula Graph

You can use `:EXIT` or `:QUIT` to disconnect from Nebula Graph. For convenience, nebula-console supports using these commands in lower case without the colon (":"), such as `quit`.

```nGQL
nebula> :QUIT

Bye root!

nebula> :EXIT

Bye root!

nebula> quit

Bye root!

nebula> exit

Bye root!
```
